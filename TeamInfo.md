## Project Summary
Flight Delay Prediction System

This is a summary of the project!
The Flight Delay Prediction System is a web application designed to predict and analyze flight delays by combining historical flight data with real-time weather conditions. It integrates a robust database infrastructure, specifically MongoDB, to store and query large datasets, such as flight schedules, delays, cancellations, and weather data. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to generate accurate delay predictions while offering insights into potential disruptions across the air travel network, accounting for factors like weather, hub congestion, and aircraft rotation patterns.
By integrating APIs for real-time weather (OpenWeatherMap), flight status (Aviation Stack), and notifications (Twilio, SendGrid), the system provides proactive alerts to users via SMS and email. The project emphasizes a database-driven approach, utilizing MongoDB to efficiently manage unstructured data and enhance prediction accuracy, setting it apart from existing flight tracking applications by offering predictive analytics based on complex, interconnected factors affecting flight operations.
