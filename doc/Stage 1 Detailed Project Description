# CS 411 Stage 1: Detailed Project Description

## Flight Delay Prediction System

### Project Summary
The Flight Delay Prediction System is a web application designed to predict and analyze flight delays by combining historical flight data with real-time weather conditions. It integrates a robust database infrastructure, specifically MongoDB, to store and query large datasets, such as flight schedules, delays, cancellations, and weather data. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to generate accurate delay predictions while offering insights into potential disruptions across the air travel network, accounting for factors like weather, hub congestion, and aircraft rotation patterns.

By integrating APIs for real-time weather (OpenWeatherMap), flight status (Aviation Stack), and notifications (Twilio, SendGrid), the system provides proactive alerts to users via SMS and email. The project emphasizes a database-driven approach, utilizing MongoDB to efficiently manage unstructured data and enhance prediction accuracy, setting it apart from existing flight tracking applications by offering predictive analytics based on complex, interconnected factors affecting flight operations.

## Project Description
The primary goal of our project is to develop a sophisticated flight delay prediction system that addresses the critical need for accurate and timely information about potential flight disruptions. Air travel delays significantly impact both passengers and airlines, with cascading effects throughout the transportation network. Our application aims to solve this problem by providing proactive delay predictions and actionable insights for better travel planning and resource allocation.

## Creative Component
Our application's creative component leverages multiple APIs and data integration techniques to provide comprehensive flight delay predictions:

- **OpenWeatherMap API** integration for real-time weather conditions at airports
- **Aviation Stack API** for current flight status and scheduling information
- **Twilio API** integration for SMS notifications about predicted delays
- **Google Maps Geocoding API** to provide airport location data and basic route visualization
- **Custom algorithm** combining weather severity scores with historical delay patterns
- **Email notification system** using SendGrid API for delay alerts

## Usefulness
The Flight Delay Prediction System offers unique value by providing:

- **SMS and email notifications** for predicted delays
- **Real-time weather impact assessment** on flights
- **Personalized alert system** for specific routes
- **Historical delay patterns** for better travel planning
- **Simple, user-friendly interface** for quick information access

While existing flight tracking applications like FlightAware and FlightRadar24 provide current flight status, our system differentiates itself by offering predictive analytics and comprehensive delay risk assessment. The application considers complex interconnected factors that affect flight operations, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction system. This helps users anticipate potential delays and plan their travel accordingly.
